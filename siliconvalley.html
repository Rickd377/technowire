                <h2>WHERE DOES SILLICON VALLEY GET ITS NAME?</h2>
                <p>Silicon Valley takes its name from the abundant
                    use of silicon, an element essential in semiconductor production. These semiconductors form the
                    core component of electronic devices such as computer chips. The term "Silicon" refers to the
                    silicon material commonly used in this industry. The valley has gained global recognition as a
                    leading center for technological innovation and is home to numerous technology companies and

                    Semiconductor, left the company in 1957 due to disagreements with Shockley over his leadership
                    style and his positions on company policies. They eventually founded their own company, called
                    Fairchild Semiconductor, which made a crucial contribution to the rise of the semiconductor

                <p>Several chip
                    companies trace their origins back to the parent company Fairchild Semiconductor, founded in
                    1957. Notable offshoots include Intel (1968), established by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore;
                    National Semiconductor (now part of Texas Instruments); AMD (1969), founded by Jerry Sanders;
                    LSI Corporation (now part of Broadcom); Maxim Integrated (1983, now part of Analog Devices); and
                    Cypress Semiconductor (1982, now part of Infineon Technologies). Each of these companies has had
                    a significant impact on the semiconductor industry.</p>

                <p>Moore's Law, formulated by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965,
                    states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every two years while
                    costs remain constant. This observation predicted the exponential growth of computing power and
                    the reduction in costs in the semiconductor industry. While the exact timeline may vary, this

                <p>Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and
                    Ronald Wayne. Steve Jobs was a visionary entrepreneur and product designer known for his
                    emphasis on user-friendliness and aesthetics. Steve Wozniak, also known as "Woz," was the
                    technical genius behind the early Apple computers and was renowned for his technical prowess.
                    Ronald Wayne was a co-founder but sold his shares early on, having limited influence on the
                    company. Together, Jobs and Wozniak laid the foundation for Apple's success by creating
